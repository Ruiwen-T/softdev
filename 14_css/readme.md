# DISCO
* The CSS file is under the static folder, while the HTML file is under templates.
* style.css is a conventional name for CSS files. 
* It's important to change the href attribute in HTML to link the CSS file properly. Instead of mimic.css, we want to link to ../static/style.css. Visual Studio Code helpfully allows us to follow links to check if they are linking to files that exist and the files that we want.
